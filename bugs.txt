Bug: Had issues finding elements because I was searching for them before the page had loaded 
(searching when waiting to pass cloudFlare).
Solution: Had the driver wait until it could detect the element (essentially waiting to pass cloudFlare), then 
once detected it was saved into a variable and then price could be retrieved
Code: 
"
price_element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.TAG_NAME, "mct-price"))
)
"

Bug: Timeout exception. Sometimes the cloudFlare doesn't pass and hangs, 
this caused the previous code to throw a timeout exception
Solution: Just had the request try again
